"""Conversation mode management for Kindex.

Modes are reusable conversation-priming artifacts that induce a processing
mode in an AI session. Each mode has a primer (state induction), a boundary
(quality definition), and permissions (what's explicitly allowed).

Modes can be created from session fingerprints, activated for new sessions,
and exported for sharing across users (PII-free).

Research basis (Papers 35-40):
- Induced understanding outperforms direct instruction by 5.4x
- 15 tokens of priming captures 98.8% of achievable benefit
- Adaptive guidance is actively harmful
- Cross-domain shifts improve quality
- Reset + prime beats expert baseline by 39%
